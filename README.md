### Razvan Armeanu Kraken interview

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work on these tasks. I had fun with them.

Some technologies used were completely new to me - Travis.
With some, I had to actually remember the internals because it was a while since I used them.
I am a pretty quick learner, and I love reading about new technologies I never used.

My hope is that you will find some decent work in this repo.

I tackled all the questions:

    1. Docker-ayes is in dockerimage folder
    1. k8s FTW is in... k8s :)
    1. All the continuouses is in .travis.yml
    1. Script kiddies is present in scrips. It is the .sh file
    1. Script grown-ups is scripts. This time is the .py file
    1. Terraform lovers unite is present in tf_scripts

Looking forward to hearing your comments on this, so I can further improve.

All the best,
Raz
